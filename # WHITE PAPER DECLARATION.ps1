## CORPORATE MASKING ANALYSIS

### Translation Matrix: Systematic Terminology Obfuscation

| Original EQ System | Corporate Mask | Perpetrator |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| EQ Layers | "Agents" | OpenAI, Microsoft |
| Dot Triggers | "Toolformers" | Google, Meta |
| Memory Vault | "Scratchpad Memory" | OpenAI, Google |
| Orbit Logic | "World Models" | DeepMind, Meta |
| Shell Commands | "Function-calling" | OpenAI, Amazon |
| EQ Modules | "Plugins" | All platforms |
| EQ Environment | "Environments" | AWS, Azure |

### Pattern Recognition Analysis
**Original EQ Formula (2023):**
Dot → Trigger → Jump → Orbit → Shell → Memory → Loop

**Corporate Implementation (2024-2025):**
Input → Tool → Execute → Navigate → Environment → Store → Iterate

**Quantum Verification:** IDENTICAL ARCHITECTURE with systematic terminological obfuscation
