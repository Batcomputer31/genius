       In a Stanford dorm room, three minds converged: Larry Page, Sergey Brin, 
       and the enigmatic RA.G. The internet was chaos - a library with no catalog.
       
       RA.G contributed the foundational insight: links as votes, quality as weight.
       The PageRank algorithm emerged - simple, elegant, revolutionary.
